<h1>When does Paxos work?</h1>
<center><b>a.k.a. what about the impossibility of consensus result?</b></center>
<script type="tex/latex">
<div class="latex">

<p>It would clearly be desirable that, if a client broadcasts a new
command to all replicas, that it eventually receives at least one
response. This is an example of a \emph{liveness} property. It
requires that if one or more commands have been proposed for a
particular slot, that some command is eventually decided for that
slot. Unfortunately, the Synod protocol as described does not
guarantee this, even in the absence of any failure whatsoever. In
fact, failures tend to be good for liveness. If all leaders but one
fail, Paxos is guaranteed to terminate.</p>

<p class="centeredImg">

</p>

<p>Consider the following scenario shown above, with two leaders with
identifiers $\lambda$ and ${\lambda'}$ such that $\lambda <
{\lambda'}$. Both start at the same time, respectively proposing
commands $c$ and $c'$ for slot number 1. Suppose there are three
acceptors, $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, and $\alpha_3$. In ballot $\langle
0, \lambda \rangle$, leader $\lambda$ is successful in getting
$\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ to adopt the ballot, and $\alpha_1$ to
accept pvalue $\langle \langle 0, \lambda \rangle, 1, c \rangle$.</p>

<p>Now leader ${\lambda'}$ gets $\alpha_2$ and $\alpha_3$ to adopt
ballot $\langle 0, {\lambda'} \rangle$, which has a higher ballot
number than ballot $\langle 0, \lambda \rangle$ because $\lambda <
{\lambda'}$. Note that neither $\alpha_2$ or $\alpha_3$ accepted any
pvalues, so leader $\lambda'$ is free to select any proposal. Leader
$\lambda'$ then gets $\alpha_3$ to accept $\langle \langle 0,
{\lambda'} \rangle, 1, c' \rangle$.</p>

<p>At this point, acceptors $\alpha_2$ and $\alpha_3$ are unable to
accept $\langle \langle 0, \lambda \rangle, 1, c \rangle$ and thus
leader $\lambda$ is unable to get a majority of acceptors to accept
$\langle \langle 0, \lambda \rangle, 1, c \rangle$. Trying again with
a higher ballot, leader $\lambda$ gets $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ to
adopt $\langle 1, \lambda \rangle$. The maximum pvalue accepted by
$\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ is $\langle \langle 0, \lambda \rangle, 1, c
\rangle$, and thus $\lambda$ must propose $c$. Suppose $\lambda$ gets
$\alpha_1$ to accept $\langle \langle 1, \lambda \rangle, 1, c
\rangle$.  Because acceptors $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ adopted
$\langle 1, \lambda \rangle$, they are unable to accept $\langle
\langle 0, {\lambda'} \rangle, 1, c' \rangle$. Trying to make
progress, leader ${\lambda'}$ gets $\alpha_2$ and $\alpha_3$ to adopt
$\langle 1, {\lambda'} \rangle$, and gets $\alpha_3$ to accept
$\langle \langle 1, {\lambda'} \rangle, 1, c' \rangle$.</p>

<p>This ping-pong scenario can be continued indefinitely, with no ballot
ever succeeding in choosing a pvalue. This is true even if $c = c'$,
that is, the leaders propose the same command. The well-known ``FLP
impossibility result'' demonstrates that in an
asynchronous environment that admits crash failures, no consensus
protocol can guarantee termination, and the Synod protocol is no
exception. The argument does not apply directly if transitions have
non-deterministic actions---for example changing state in a randomized
manner. However, it can be demonstrated that such protocols cannot
guarantee a decision either.</p>

<p>If we could somehow guarantee that some leader would be able to
work long enough to get a majority of acceptors to adopt a high ballot
and also accept a pvalue, then Paxos would be guaranteed to choose a
proposed command. A possible approach could be as follows: when a
leader $\lambda$ discovers, through a $\texttt{preempted}$ message,
that there is a higher ballot with leader ${\lambda'}$ active, rather
than starting a new scout with an even higher ballot number, $\lambda$
starts monitoring $\lambda'$ by pinging it on a regular basis. As long
as ${\lambda'}$ responds timely to pings, $\lambda$ waits
patiently. Only if ${\lambda'}$ stops responding will $\lambda$ select
a higher ballot number and start a scout.</p>

<p>This concept is called \emph{failure detection}, and theoreticians
have been interested in the weakest properties failure detection
should have in order to support a consensus algorithm that is
guaranteed to terminate. In a purely asynchronous
environment, it is impossible to determine through pinging or any other
method whether a particular leader has crashed or is simply slow.
However, under fairly weak assumptions about timing, we can design a
version of Paxos that is guaranteed to choose a proposal. In
particular, we will assume that both the following are bounded:</p>

<ul>
<li> the clock drift of a process, that is, the rate of its clock is
  within some factor of the rate of real-time;</li>
<li> the time between when a non-faulty process initiates sending a
  message, and the message having been received and handled by a
  non-faulty destination process.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not need to assume that we know what those bounds are---only
that such bounds exist. From a practical point of view, this seems
entirely reasonable. Modern clocks progress certainly within a factor
of 2 of real-time. A message between two non-faulty processes is
likely delivered and processed within, say, a year.
Even if the network was partitioned at the time the sender started
sending the message, by the time a year has expired the message is
highly likely to have been delivered and processed.</p>

<p>These assumptions can be exploited as follows: we use a scheme similar
to the one described above, based on pinging and timeouts, but the
value of the timeout interval depends on the ballot number: the higher
the competing ballot number, the longer a leader waits before trying
to preempt it with a higher ballot number. Eventually the timeout at
each of the leaders becomes so high that some correct leader will
always be able to get its proposals chosen.</p>

<p>For good performance, one would like the timeout period to be long
enough so that a leader can be successful, but short enough so that
the ballots of a faulty leader are preempted quickly.
This can be achieved with a TCP-like AIMD (Additive Increase,
Multiplicative Decrease) approach for choosing timeouts. The leader
associates an initial timeout with each ballot. If a ballot gets
preempted, the next ballot uses a timeout that is multiplied by some
small factor larger than one. With each chosen proposal, this initial
timeout is decreased linearly. Eventually the timeout will become too
short, and the ballot will be replaced with another even if its leader
is non-faulty.</p>

<p>Liveness can be further improved by keeping state on disk. The Paxos
protocol can tolerate a minority of its acceptors failing, and all but
one of its replicas and leaders failing. If more than that fail,
consistency is still guaranteed, but liveness will be violated. A
process that suffers from a power failure but can recover from disk is
not theoretically considered crashed---it is simply slow for a
while. Only a process that suffers a permanent disk failure would be
considered crashed.</p>

<p>For completeness, we note that for liveness we also assumed reliable
communication. This assumption can be weakened by using a
<em>fair links</em> assumption: if a correct process repeatedly sends a message
to another correct process, at least one copy is eventually
delivered. Reliable transmission of a message can then be implemented
by periodic retransmission until an ack is received. In order to
prevent overload on the network, the time intervals between
retransmissions can grow until the load imposed on the network is
negligible. The fair links assumption can be weakened further, but
such a discussion is outside the scope of this paper.</p>

<p>As an example of how liveness is achieved, a correct client retransmits its
request to replicas until it has received a response. Because there
are at least $~f+1$ replicas, at least one of those replicas will not
fail and will assign a slot to the request and send a proposal to the
$~f+1$ or more leaders. Thus at least one correct leader will try to
get a command decided for that slot. Should a competing command get
decided, the replica will reassign the request to a new slot and retry.
While this may lead to starvation, in the absence of new requests,
any outstanding request will eventually get decided in at least one
slot.</p>
