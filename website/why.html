<h1>Why use Paxos?</h1>

<p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf"
target="_blank"><b>Paxos</b></a> is a protocol for state machine
replication in an asynchronous environment that admits crash
failures.</p>

<p>A replicated state machine works by having multiple state machines,
also called replicas, working in parallel, maintaining the same
state. When the replicas receive requests from a client they update
their state by executing the command in the request and reply to the
client. This way, the state is automatically replicated by the
replicas and in the event of a failure the state does not get lost,
making the replicated state machine reliable.</p>

<p>It is easy for replicas to execute client commands in the same
order and remain in sync if there is only one client or if multiple
clients send their requests strictly sequentially as shown below:</p>

</center>

<p>In this example replicas receive requests from clients in the same
order, execute the commands in the same order and respond to the
clients, in effect staying in sync. For simplicity, it is assumed that
a client can ignore duplicated responses.</p>

<p>But if multiple clients send requests to replicas in parallel, then
different replicas might receive these requests in different orders
and execute the commands in different orders, causing their local
states to diverge from one another over time. </p>

<p>To prevent replicas from diverging in the presence of multiple
clients sending requests in parallel, the order in which the client
commands will be executed by replicas should be decided. We show this
case below:</p>

<center>
<img src="static/consensus.gif" width="60%">
</center>

<p>To decide the order in which the client commands will be executed
the replicas can be thought of as having a sequence of slots that need
to be filled with commands that make up the inputs to the state
machine they maintain. In the example this sequence is shown as a
table. Each slot is indexed by a slot number, starting from
1. Replicas receive requests from clients and assign them to specific
slots, creating a sequence of commands. In the face of concurrently
operating clients, different replicas may end up proposing different
commands for the same slot. To avoid inconsistency, a consensus
protocol chooses a single command from the proposals for every slot.
In Paxos the subprotocol that implements consensus is called
the <b>multi-decree Synod</b> protocol, or just <b>Synod</b> protocol
for short. A replica awaits the decision before actually updating its
sequence of commands in the table, executing the next command and
computing a response to send back to the client that issued the
request.</p>

<p>Essentially, the replicated state machine uses Paxos as an ordering
entity which uses consensus to agree on which client command gets
assigned to which slot. One has to make sure that the ordering entity
itself is also reliable, that it can tolerate failures (at
most <em>f</em>) just like the replicated state machine. To achieve
reliability, Paxos is run by multiple specialized processes in a
distributed fashion. This is not trivial because up to <em>f</em>
processes running Paxos might fail at any time and, because there is
no bound on timing for delivering and processing messages, it is
impossible for other processes to know for certain that the process
has failed.
</p>

<p>Now you understand why one would want to use the infamous Paxos
protocol! If you are curious about <a href="how.html"><b>How Paxos
Works</b></a>, we cover it by explaining how every specialized process
in Paxos works. We do not use theorems and proofs but only
invariants and pseudocode!
</p>

<p>If you would rather get lost
in <a href="code.html"><b>Code</b></a>, we have very well commented
code that works and explains all the variables and the state
changes!</p>
