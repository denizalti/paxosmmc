<h1>How do Replicas work?</h1>
<script type="tex/latex">
<div class="latex">
<p>When a client $\kappa$ wants to execute a command $c = \langle\kappa,
\textit{cid}, \textit{op}\rangle$, its stub routine broadcasts a
$\langle\textbf{request}, c\rangle$ message to all replicas and waits for a
$\langle\textbf{response}, \textit{cid}, \textit{result}\rangle$ message from
one of the replicas.</p>

<p>The replicas can be thought of as having a sequence of $\emph{slots}.
that need to be filled with commands that make up the inputs to the
state machine. Each slot is indexed by a \emph{slot number}.
Replicas receive requests from clients and assign them to specific
slots, creating a sequence of commands. A replica, on receipt of a
$\langle\textbf{request}, c\rangle$ message, proposes command $c$ for its
lowest unused slot. We call the pair $(s, c)$ a \emph{proposal} for
slot $s$.</p>

<p>Replicas use the Synod protocol to choose a single command for each
slot from the proposals they make. For each slot, the Synod protocol
runs between a set of processes called the configuration of the
slot. The configuration contains the leaders and the acceptors, but
not the replicas. Leaders receive proposed commands from replicas and
are responsible for choosing a single command for the slot. Thus, in
order to tolerate $~f$ crash failures, Paxos needs at least $f + 1$
leaders, always leaving at least $1$ leader to order the commands
proposed by replicas. A replica awaits the decision before actually
updating its state and computing a response to send back to the client
that issued the request.</p>

<p>Usually, the configuration for consecutive slots is the
same. Sometimes, such as when a process in the configuration is
suspected of having crashed, it is useful to be able to change the
configuration. Paxos supports reconfiguration: a client can propose a
special reconfiguration command, which is decided in a slot just like
any other command. However, if $s$ is the index of the slot in which a
new configuration is decided, it does not take effect until slot $s +
\mathtt{WINDOW}$. This allows up to $\mathtt{WINDOW}$ slots to have
proposals pending—the configuration of later slots may change. It is
always possible to add new replicas—this does not require a
reconfiguration of the leaders and acceptors.</p>

<!-- Replica State and Invariants -->
<h6>Replica State</h6>
<p>Each replica $\rho$ maintains seven variables:

<ul>
<li>$\rho.\textit{state}$, the replica's copy of the application
  state, which we will treat as opaque.  All replicas start with the
  same initial application state.</li>
<li>$\rho.\textit{slot_in}$, the index of the next slot in which the
  replica has not yet proposed any command. Initially 1.</li>
<li>$\rho.\textit{slot_out}$, the index of the next slot for which it
  needs to learn a decision before it can update its copy of the
  application state.  Equivalent to the state's version number (i.e.,
  number of updates), and initially 1.</li>
<li>$\rho.\textit{requests}$, an initially empty set of requests that
  the replica has received and are not yet proposed or decided.</li>
<li>$\rho.\textit{proposals}$, an initially empty set of proposals
  that are currently outstanding.</li>
<li>$\rho.\textit{decisions}$, another set of proposals that are known
  to have been decided (also initially empty).</li>
<li>$\rho.\textit{leaders}$, the set of leaders in the current
configuration.  The leaders of the initial configuration are passed
as an argument to the replica.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h6>Replica Invariants</h6>
<p>For correctness following invariants hold over the collected
variables of replicas both before and after state transitions:

<ul>
<li>R1: There are no two different commands decided for the same slot:
  $~~~\forall s, \rho_1, \rho_2, c_1, c_2: \langle s, c_1 \rangle \in
  {\rho_1}.\textit{decisions} ~\wedge~ \langle s, c_2 \rangle \in
  {\rho_2}.\textit{decisions} \Rightarrow c_1 = c_2$</li>

<li>R2: All commands up to $\textit{slot_out}$ are in the set of
  decisions: $~~~\forall \rho, s: 1 \leq s < \rho.\textit{slot_out}
  \Rightarrow \exists c : \langle s, c \rangle \in
  \rho.\textit{decisions}$</li>

<li>R3: For all replicas $\rho$, $\rho.\textit{state}$ is the result
  of applying the commands $\langle s, c_s \rangle \in
  \rho.\textit{decisions}$ to $\textit{initial_state}$ for all $s$ up
  to $\textit{slot_out}$, in order of slot number;</li>

<li>R4: For each $\rho$, the variable $\rho.\textit{slot_out}$ cannot
  decrease over time.</li>

<li>R5: A replica proposes commands only for slots it knows the
  configuration for: $~~~\forall \rho: \rho.\textit{slot_in} <
  \rho.\textit{slot_out} + \mathtt{WINDOW}$.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
To understand the significance of such invariants, it is useful to
consider what would happen if one of the invariants would not hold.
If R1 would not hold, replicas could \emph{diverge}, ending up in
different states even if they have applied the same number of
commands.  Also, without R1, the same replica could decide multiple
different commands for the same slot, because $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$
could be the same process. Thus, the application state of that replica
would be ambiguous.
</p>
<p>
Invariants R2-R4 ensure that, for each replica $\rho$, the sequence of
the first $\rho.\textit{slot_out}$ commands is recorded and fixed.
If any of these invariants were invalidated, a replica could change
its history and end up with a different application state.  The
invariants do not imply that the slots have to be decided in order;
they only imply that decided commands have to be applied to the
application state in order and that there is no way to roll back.
</p>
<p>
Invariant R5 guarantees that replicas do not propose commands for
slots that have an uncertain configuration.
Because a configuration for slot $s$ takes effect at slot
$s + \mathtt{WINDOW}$ and all decisions up to $\textit{slot_in} - 1$
are known, configurations up to slot
$\rho.\textit{slot_in} + \mathtt{WINDOW} - 1$ are known.</p>

<div class="latex">

<p> A replica runs in an infinite loop, receiving messages.  Replicas
receive two kinds of messages: requests and decisions.  When it
receives a request for command $c$ from a client, the replica adds the
request to set $\textit{requests}$. Next, the replica invokes the
function $\textit{propose}()$.</p>

<p>Function $\textit{propose}()$ tries to transfer requests from the
set $\textit{requests}$ to $\textit{proposals}$.  It uses
$\textit{slot_in}$ to look for unused slots within the window of slots
with known configurations. For each such slot $s$, it first checks if
the configuration for $s$ is different from the prior slot by checking
if the decision in slot $s - \mathtt{WINDOW}$ is a reconfiguration
command.  If so, the function updates the set of leaders for slot $s$.
Then the function removes a request $r$ from $\textit{requests}$ and
adds proposal $(s, r)$ to the set $\textit{proposals}$.  Finally, it
sends a $\langle\textbf{propose}, s, c\rangle$ message to all leaders
in the configuration of slot $s$.</p>

<p>Decisions may arrive out-of-order and multiple times.  For each
$\textbf{decision}$ message, the replica adds the decision to the set
$\textit{decisions}$.  Then, in a loop, it considers which decisions are
ready for execution before trying to receive more messages.  If there
is a decision $c'$ corresponding to the current $\textit{slot_out}$,
the replica first checks to see if it has proposed a command $c''$ for
that slot.  If so, the replica removes $\langle\textit{slot_out},
c''\rangle$ from the set $\textit{proposals}$.  If $c'' \ne c'$, that
is, the replica proposed a different command for that slot, the
replica returns $c''$ to set $\textit{requests}$ so $c''$ is proposed
again at a later time.  Next, the replica invokes
$\textit{perform}(c')$.</p>

<p>The function $\textit{perform}()$ is invoked with the same sequence
of commands at all replicas.  First, it checks to see if it has
already performed the command.  Different replicas may end up
proposing the same command for different slots, and thus the same
command may be decided multiple times.  The corresponding operation is
evaluated only if the command is new and it is not a reconfiguration
request.  If so, $\textit{perform}()$ applies the requested operation
to the application state.  In either case, the function increments
$\textit{slot_out}$.</p>

<h6>Maintenance of Replica Invariants</h6>

<p>Note that both $\textit{proposals}$ and $\textit{decisions}$ are
``append-only'' in that there is no code that removes entries from
these sets. Doing so makes it easier to formulate invariants and
reason about the correctness of the code. We will discuss
correctness-preserving ways of removing entries that are no longer
useful in the context of optimizations later.
</p>

<p>It is clear that the code enforces <b>Invariant R4</b>.  The variables
$\textit{state}$ and $\textit{slot_out}$ are updated atomically in
order to ensure that <b>Invariant R3</b> holds, although in practice it is
not actually necessary to perform these updates atomically, as the
intermediate state is not externally visible.  Since
$\textit{slot_out}$ is only advanced if the corresponding decision is
in $\textit{decisions}$, it is clear that <b>Invariant R2</b> holds.  A
command is proposed for a slot only if that slot is within the current
$\mathtt{WINDOW}$, and since replicas execute reconfiguration commands
after a $\mathtt{WINDOW}$ of operations it is ensured that <b>Invariant
R5</b> holds.</p>

<p>The real difficulty lies in enforcing <b>Invariant R1</b>.  It requires
that the set of replicas agree on the order of commands.  For each
slot, the Paxos protocol \emph{chooses} a command from among a
collection of commands proposed by clients.  This is called
\emph{consensus}, and in Paxos the subprotocol that implements
consensus is called the ``multi-decree Synod'' protocol, or just Synod
protocol for short.</p>
